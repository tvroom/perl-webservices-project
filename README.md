Perl WebServices Project

The Perl WebServices Project seeks to identify API documentation pages that don't list a Perl implementation.

When a Perl implementation exists we'll try to get that linked from the official documentation page.  

When a Perl implementation doesn't exist we'll track that and make it publicly available as an idea of a module for someone to develop.

We're just starting out, but if you see API documentation that doesn't include a reference to Perl, file an issue here pointing to that documentation page for the API.
